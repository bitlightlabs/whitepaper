# BitLight: Secure, Private, and Efficient Stablecoin Trading on Bitcoin's Layer 2

## Overview

BitLight is an innovative project that integrates the **RGB protocol** with the **Lightning Network** to enable secure, private, and efficient stablecoin trading on Bitcoin's Layer 2 (L2). By leveraging the RGB protocol's capabilities for asset issuance and the Lightning Network's fast, low-cost transactions, BitLight provides a robust platform for stablecoin trading. A key feature of BitLight is its **keyless custody mechanism**, which enhances security and user convenience by eliminating the need for private key storage.

This repository contains the **BitLight Whitepaper**, which outlines the architecture, design principles, and implementation details of the BitLight project. It also discusses the challenges faced and future directions for the project.

## Key Features

- **Integration of RGB Protocol and Lightning Network**: BitLight seamlessly combines the asset issuance capabilities of the RGB protocol with the transactional efficiency of the Lightning Network, enabling fast, low-cost, and private stablecoin transactions.
  
- **Keyless Custody Mechanism**: BitLight implements a keyless custody model, eliminating the need for users to manage private keys directly. This enhances security and usability, reducing the risk of key loss or theft.

- **Taproot Support**: BitLight fully supports **Taproot**, enabling more efficient and private transactions on both the RGB and Lightning Network protocol.

- **Atomic Swaps**: BitLight experimentally enables **atomic swaps** between RGB assets and Bitcoin or other supported assets, allowing for trustless and decentralized exchanges without intermediaries.

- **Privacy-Focused Financial Applications**: BitLight supports the development of privacy-centric financial applications, ensuring user privacy and data security.
